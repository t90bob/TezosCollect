# üêï DIPE Protocol on Dogecoin

## Introduction

DIPE is a Dogecoin native token protocol inspired by BennyTheDev's "PIPE Protocol" and BRC-20 Ordinals tokens on Bitcoin.            \
\
Like PIPE/BRC-20, DIPE consists of 3 "functions": Deploy, Mint, and Transfer. Deploy signals that a new token has been deployed, Mint allows to mint from this token, based on deployments rules of supply/limit. Once indexed, transfer is used to send tokens to selected recipients. \
\
This documentation of DIPE describes how each of the functions should be reflected within Dogecoin transactions and how indexers/wallets must treat those. Further upgrades may be progressively added and enhanced with this document.                   &#x20;

### Disclaimer:&#x20;

DIPE is a new experimental protocol, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. DIPE will not be indexed within doge wallets right away. Please use a brand new wallet to avoid losing any doginals.&#x20;
